# MyTube Expo App

This is a simple mobile app front-end for MyTube instances, built with React Native, Expo, and Apollo.

The long-term goal of the project is to provide a user friendly, mobile-optimized way to access MyTube instances, including searching content and streaming videos. MyTube's administrative features are not currently planned to be supported.

## Installing

This app is not currently published to any app stores, but may be at some point in the future. To install the app on your device, download the IPA or APK file from the latest release, and manually install the application from the file.

## Development

We use Expo to build the app. A basic development environment can be started with the Expo CLI:

npm ci
expo start
```
